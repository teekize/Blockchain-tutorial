# Blockchain-tutorial

the main aim of this repo is to highlight how truffle works. 
I have made my own tool that compiles the contract, tests the contracts and deployes the contract on the rinkeby test network of etherium.

the contract executed here is quite simple and is made so , so that we can really get to see what happens when using a tool like truffle.

solidity version 0.4.17 is used.

nodejs is used.
